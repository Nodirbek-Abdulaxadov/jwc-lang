## [0.4.0] — Array + Builtin Parity

### Added
- **Array literals** — `[1, 2, 3]`, the empty form `[]`, and heterogeneous
  elements (`[1, "two", true]`). Iterable with `for x in xs`. Works in both the
  interpreter and native AOT.
- **Array builtins** — `range(n)` / `range(start, end)` / `range(start, end,
  step)`, `push(arr, x)` / `append(arr, x)` (in-place), and `join(arr, sep)`
  (O(n)). `length`/`first`/`last`/`contains` now accept arrays directly.
- **Hash builtins** — `sha256`, `sha1`, `md5`, and `hmac_sha256` (lowercase
  hex), backed by a new `src/hash.rs` with known-vector tests (incl. RFC 4231).
- **Custom MIME responses** — `response(body, mime)` (alias `raw`) ships a body
  verbatim under an explicit Content-Type (`; charset=utf-8` appended to
  `text/*`). `text(body)` now works in the interpreter too.
- **Module-level `const`** — top-level `const NAME = expr;` visible read-only in
  routes, functions, middlewares, and main; compile-time rejection of
  non-constant expressions, undeclared references, duplicates, and cycles.
- **Graceful shutdown** — `serve()` drains inflight requests on Ctrl+C with a
  `JWC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` (default 5s) watchdog; open WebSockets get a `1001`
  close frame (interpreter).

### Changed
- Built-in metadata consolidated into a single source of truth
  (`src/builtins.rs` `BUILTIN_DEFS`); the native-AOT whitelist and lint pass
  derive from it. The interpreter's built-in evaluators were split into
  `src/runner/builtins.rs`.

### Fixed
- Native AOT now accepts `hash_password` / `verify_password` (argon2id) — they
  were previously interpreter-only and rejected at native-build time.
- `ok`, `not_found`, `no_content`, `bad_request`, and `internal_error` no longer
  error with "Unknown function" in the interpreter; they are dispatched in both
  runtimes. (Remaining error-body shape differences are tracked in
  `docs/parity-notes.md`, deferred to v0.4.1.)
